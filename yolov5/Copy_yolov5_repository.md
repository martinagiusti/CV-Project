Copy the yolov5 git hub repository, in order to start from the pretrained model yolov5s weights. The repository is at [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).
The only difference is that the file val.py is modified and attached in this folder.
In folder runs/val there are reported the results and some examples of detection on the different test foledrs.
